# Best-practices retrofit audit — 2026-10-07

Scope: `pddads-skill-lite` only. This is a repository/behavior-design audit, not platform certification, live account verification, or a model-quality claim.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SKILL.md below 500 lines | PASS | Enforced by `scripts/release_gate.py`. |
| Runtime references are one hop from SKILL.md | PASS | Reference map is direct; nested reference directories fail release. |
| Long references have a content list | PASS (guarded) | Future references over 100 lines without a top contents heading fail release. |
| Degrees of freedom explicit | PASS | Strategy = high, planning shape = medium, deterministic calculations/validation = low. |
| Ordered checklist | PASS | SKILL.md contains the order-sensitive checklist and return-on-failure rule. |
| Self-correction loop | PASS | Draft → validate → repair → revalidate; validator weakening is forbidden. |
| Dependencies explicit | PASS | Python 3.10+ standard library only; no third-party runtime dependency. |
| Cross-model evaluation | NOT_RUN | Required lanes are defined in `evals/MODEL_EVAL_MATRIX.md`; real host/model runs remain pending. |

Structural hardening never upgrades an inaccessible or stale source into verified platform capability. CI PASS does not imply live feature availability, attribution correctness, legal approval, or performance.
